## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

<details>
<summary>How is NutriBites different from Monika?</summary>

While both features use AI to provide nutritional guidance:

- **NutriBites** focuses specifically on analyzing your meal history and patterns over time. It provides insights based on the meals you've already logged and helps you understand trends in your eating habits.

- **Monika** is a broader nutritional assistant that can answer general nutrition questions, provide dietary recommendations, and offer guidance even unrelated to your specific meal history.

NutriBites is available to all users (including free plan), while Monika is only available to Track and Premium subscribers.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does NutriBites require an internet connection?</summary>

Yes, NutriBites requires an active internet connection to process your questions and analyze your meal data. This is because the natural language processing and analysis happen on our secure servers rather than on your device.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How far back can NutriBites analyze my meal history?</summary>

NutriBites can analyze your entire meal history in the app. However, please note:

- Free plan users can access up to 7 days of meal history
- Track and Premium users have unlimited meal history access

The more meal data you have, the more comprehensive insights NutriBites can provide about your long-term patterns.
</details>

### Using NutriBites Effectively

<details>
<summary>What types of questions give the best results?</summary>

For the most helpful insights, try:

1. **Specific timeframes**: "What did I eat last Tuesday?" rather than just "What did I eat?"
2. **Focused nutritional queries**: "How much protein did I eat yesterday?" rather than "Was my diet good?"
3. **Comparative questions**: "Compare my breakfast and lunch nutrition" rather than "Tell me about my meals"
4. **Pattern-seeking questions**: "When do I tend to eat high-sugar foods?" rather than "Do I eat healthy?"

Being specific helps NutriBites provide more targeted and actionable information.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I ask follow-up questions?</summary>

Yes! NutriBites maintains context within a conversation, so you can ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into topics. For example:

1. You: "What did I eat yesterday?"
2. NutriBites: [Provides list of meals]
3. You: "Which one had the most protein?"
4. NutriBites: [Identifies the highest-protein meal]
5. You: "Show me more details about that meal"

This conversational approach allows for more natural and in-depth exploration of your nutrition data.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why doesn't NutriBites understand my question?</summary>

If NutriBites is having trouble understanding your question:

- **Be more specific** about what information you're seeking
- **Rephrase** using simpler, more direct language
- **Check** that you have meal data for the timeframe you're asking about
- **Break down** complex questions into smaller, more focused ones

NutriBites works best with clear questions that relate directly to your meal data and nutrition patterns.
</details>
