## Overview

NutriScore is NutriScan's proprietary nutritional rating system that provides an at-a-glance assessment of your meal's overall nutritional quality. Using a dual letter grade (A-E) and color-coded scale with detailed breakdown, NutriScore helps you make more informed dietary choices without needing to understand complex nutritional data.

:::tip INSTANT INSIGHT
NutriScore appears on every meal scan, giving you immediate feedback on the nutritional value of what you're eating with both a letter grade and color!
:::

## Understanding Your NutriScore

### Letter and Color Scale

NutriScore uses a comprehensive grading system with both letters (A through E) and colors to help you quickly assess the nutritional quality of your meals:

<div class="score-container">
  <div class="score-card dark-green">
    <div class="score-grade">A</div>

### Viewing Your NutriScore

NutriScore is prominently displayed in several places throughout the app:

1. **Meal Details Screen**: After scanning a meal, the NutriScore appears at the top of the nutritional breakdown, showing both letter grade (A-E) and color
2. **Calendar View**: In the Insights section, each day shows the color of your overall daily NutriScore
3. **Meal Timeline**: Each meal entry includes its NutriScore color and letter grade indicator

## How NutriScore Is Calculated

<div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ClaimReview">
  <span itemprop="claimReviewed">NutriScore evaluates multiple factors to determine the overall quality of your meal</span>
  <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization">
    <meta itemprop="name" content="NutriScan Nutritional Science Team">
  </span>
  <meta itemprop="reviewRating" content="5">
  <span itemprop="citation">Based on research by Gómez-Donoso et al., International Journal of Obesity (2021)</span>
</div>

NutriScore evaluates multiple factors to determine the overall quality of your meal and assign the appropriate letter grade and color:

| Factor | What's Evaluated | Impact on Score |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Macronutrient Balance | Ratio of proteins, carbs, and fats | Higher with balanced proportions |
| Caloric Density | Calories relative to nutritional value | Higher with nutrient-dense, lower-calorie foods |
| Micronutrient Content | Presence of vitamins, minerals, and fiber | Higher with diverse micronutrients |
| Processed Components | Level of processing and additives | Lower with highly processed ingredients |
| Nutritional Alignment | Match with your specific health goals (weight loss, muscle gain, diabetes management, etc.) | Higher when aligned with your stated health objectives |

:::info PERSONALIZED SCORING
After completing the Food Preference Form, NutriScore calculations are specifically tailored to your health goals (weight loss, muscle gain, diabetes management, pregnancy, PCOS) and dietary preferences. A meal perfect for someone building muscle may score differently for someone managing diabetes!
:::

## Goal-Based Customization

<div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ClaimReview">
  <span itemprop="claimReviewed">NutriScore adapts its evaluation criteria based on specific health objectives</span>
  <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization">
    <meta itemprop="name" content="NutriScan Nutritional Science Team">
  </span>
  <meta itemprop="reviewRating" content="5">
  <span itemprop="citation">Based on personalized nutrition research by Gardner et al., JAMA (2022)</span>
</div>

NutriScore adapts its evaluation criteria based on your specific health objectives:

| Health Goal | How NutriScore Adapts | Key Nutritional Focus |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Weight Loss** | Emphasizes nutrient density with lower calories | Protein-rich, fiber-rich, lower-calorie options |
| **Muscle Gain** | Prioritizes protein content and nutrient timing | Higher protein, complex carbs, recovery nutrients |
| **Diabetes Management** | Focuses on glycemic impact and carb quality | Low glycemic index foods, fiber, healthy fats |
| **Pregnancy Support** | Highlights critical prenatal nutrients | Folate, iron, calcium, omega-3, appropriate calories |
| **PCOS Management** | Evaluates impact on insulin sensitivity | Anti-inflammatory foods, low GI carbs, healthy fats |

The algorithm intelligently adjusts what constitutes an "ideal" nutritional profile based on your specific needs, ensuring recommendations are truly personalized to your health journey.

## Nutritional Breakdown

Every NutriScore is accompanied by a detailed nutritional breakdown to help you understand the rating:

### Macronutrient Analysis

<div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ClaimReview">
  <span itemprop="claimReviewed">Proper macronutrient balance is essential for optimal health and nutrition</span>
  <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization">
    <meta itemprop="name" content="Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics">
  </span>
  <meta itemprop="reviewRating" content="5">
  <span itemprop="citation">Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics on Macronutrient Distribution (2021)</span>
</div>

Your meal's macronutrients are displayed with both absolute values and percentage of recommended daily intake:

- **Calories**: Total energy content
- **Protein**: Building blocks for muscle and tissue
- **Carbohydrates**: Primary energy source
- **Fat**: Essential for hormone production and nutrient absorption

If carbohydrates or fats exceed your daily target, they will be highlighted in red in the Premium Plan to alert you.

### Micronutrient Highlights

The system identifies the top 4 micronutrients in your meal, ordered from highest to lowest concentration:

- **Fiber**: Digestive health and satiety
- **Potassium**: Muscle and heart function
- **Calcium**: Bone and dental health
- **Omega-3**: Brain health and inflammation reduction
- And many others

For example:
- If your goal is **weight loss**, meals with better protein-to-calorie ratios may score higher
- If your goal is **muscle gain**, higher protein meals with quality carbs may be favored
- If you're managing **diabetes**, the system places greater emphasis on glycemic impact
- If you're **pregnant**, meals rich in folate, iron, and other prenatal nutrients receive higher scores
- If you're managing **PCOS**, meals that support hormone balance and insulin sensitivity are prioritized

This personalization means your scores reflect not just general nutritional quality but alignment with your specific health journey. Two users might receive different scores for the same meal based on their individual profiles and goals.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does NutriScore appear in the calendar view?</summary>

In the Insights section's calendar view:

- Each day is color-coded with your overall NutriScore for that day
- The color represents the average nutritional quality of all meals logged that day
- Tapping on a specific day shows the breakdown of individual meals
- This view helps you identify patterns in your nutritional intake over time

This feature is particularly useful for tracking how your diet quality fluctuates throughout the week or month.
</details>

### Technical Questions

<details>
<summary>What happens if I edit my meal after seeing the NutriScore?</summary>

When you make edits to your meal:

1. Adding or removing items will trigger a recalculation of your NutriScore
2. Adjusting portion sizes will update the score proportionally
3. Your new score will be displayed immediately after the changes are saved

This allows you to see in real-time how different modifications affect the nutritional quality of your meal.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I see NutriScores for my historical meals before I had the app?</summary>

NutriScore is only available for meals that have been scanned and logged in the NutriScan app. Historical meals that were consumed before using the app cannot be retroactively scored.

However, if you have photos of past meals, you can scan them to get NutriScores and add them to your timeline.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Are NutriScores comparable across different types of meals?</summary>

Yes, NutriScores are designed to provide a standardized assessment across different meal types. However, it's important to understand that:

- The score evaluates nutritional quality, not appropriateness for a specific mealtime
- A high-scoring snack and high-scoring dinner may have different nutritional profiles but similar overall quality relative to their category
- The system accounts for the typical role of different meal types in overall nutrition

This standardization helps you make informed choices regardless of meal type.
</details>

## Common Score Scenarios

Understanding how different meals typically score can help you interpret your own results:

| Example Meal | Typical Score | Reasoning |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Vegetable salad with lean protein | A (Dark Green) | High micronutrient content, good macronutrient balance |
| Grilled fish with whole grains | B (Light Green) | Good protein source, healthy fats, complex carbs |
| Turkey sandwich on whole grain | C (Yellow) | Balanced but may lack diverse micronutrients |
| Cheese pizza | D (Orange) | Higher in refined carbs and saturated fat, limited micronutrients |
| Fast food burger and fries | E (Red) | High in saturated fat, sodium, and calories with few micronutrients |

:::warning INDIVIDUAL VARIATIONS
These examples are generalizations. Your specific meal compositions, portion sizes, and personal dietary goals will affect the actual scores you receive. The same meal might score differently for someone focused on weight loss versus someone managing diabetes.
