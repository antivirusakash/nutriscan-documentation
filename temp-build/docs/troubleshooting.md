# Troubleshooting

## General App Issues
- **Slow or Unresponsive App:**
  - **Check Internet:** Make sure your network connection is stable. Switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data to test.
  - **Restart the App:** Close the app completely and reopen it.
  - **Update the App:** Ensure you are using the latest version available in the App Store or Play Store.
  - **Clear Cache:** Go to your phone's settings and clear the app cache if the option is available.
  - **Reinstall:** If problems persist, uninstall and reinstall the app.

- **App Crashes/Unexpected Errors:**
  - **Force Stop:** Use your device's task manager to force stop the app and then restart it.
  - **Report Error:** Note any error messages displayed and report them using the in-app feedback form.
  - **Device Compatibility:** Check if your device meets the minimum system requirements.

## Permission Issues
- **Camera & Photos:**
  - **Issue:** Meal photos not uploading or scan not working.
  - **Solution:** Go to your device settings and check if the app has camera and photos access. Enable permissions if disabled.
- **Location Permission:**
  - **Issue:** Mobile sign-in may not appear or map insights not loading.
  - **Solution:** Allow location permission in your settings. If denied, the app will have limited functionality.
- **Microphone Permission:**
  - **Issue:** Voice commands with Monika or NutriBites not working.
  - **Solution:** Enable microphone permission in the app settings.
- **Notification Permission:**
  - **Issue:** Missing alerts for updates or trial reminders.
  - **Solution:** Check that notifications are allowed in both your phone settings and within the app.

## Sign In & OTP Issues
- **OTP Not Received:**
  - **Verify Number:** Make sure your mobile number is entered correctly.
  - **Network Check:** Ensure you have a strong network signal.
  - **Resend Option:** Use the "Resend OTP" button after a brief wait.
  - **Alternate Sign In:** If OTP issues persist, try signing in with Google or Apple ID.
- **Location Blocking Sign In:**
  - **Issue:** Mobile number sign in not shown.
  - **Solution:** Confirm that you have granted location permission, as this is required for mobile number sign in in India.

## Payment Issues
- **Payment Failure:**
  - **Check Network & Balance:** Ensure your internet is stable and you have sufficient funds.
  - **Retry Payment:** Wait a few minutes and try again if the screen shows payment processing.
  - **Error Codes:** Note any error codes displayed and report them through support.
- **Payment Processing Delays:**
  - **Wait Screen:** If the app shows a "processing" screen, give it a few extra minutes.
  - **Bank Notifications:** Sometimes, your bank might need confirmation. Check your messages for any alerts.
- **Post-Payment Discrepancies:**
  - **Confirmation Missing:** If you made a payment and do not see an upgrade confirmation, verify your bank statement and contact support with your transaction ID.

## Meal Scan & Nutrition Details
- **Poor Image Quality:**
  - **Lighting & Focus:** Make sure you are in a well-lit area and the image is in focus. Avoid blurry images.
  - **Retake Option:** Use the "Retake" button to capture a better picture.
- **Scan Errors:**
  - **Re-scan:** If the analysis fails, try scanning the meal again.
  - **Check Permissions:** Ensure camera and photo access permissions are enabled.
  - **Internet Connection:** A weak connection might affect image processing.
